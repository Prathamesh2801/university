        A university is an institution of higher education that offers undergraduate and graduate degrees, and is typically larger and has a broader curriculum than a college: 
        Definition
The word "university" comes from the Latin phrase universitas magistrorum et scholarium, which means "community of teachers and scholars". 
Size
Universities are usually large, with sizable campuses. Public universities can enroll tens of thousands of students, while private universities are often smaller and more selective
Universities offer a variety of programs and degrees in several academic disciplines.
